### Provenance

**Data** 
This project was developed as a proof-of-concept to aid the rapid uptake and ultimate mastery of complex software projects. The data used to construct the synthetic training sets was sourced entirely from the Linux open source software project [5] which is licensed under GPL2, and other permissive licenses. The author is not aware of any underlying 

**Reproducability** 
The code written in this project is the author's work, made possible by a host of righteous open source software packages, tools, and the Ubuntu Linux distribution. Code snippets sourced from articles, tutorials and large-language model chat sessions are annotated in the source code where appropriate. All results here should be reproducible freely, without any licensing implications. 

**Harmful Content** 
The synthetic datasets generated are based purely on Linux kernel symbols and their associated references. Source code and comments are ingeseted into the question datasets used for training. A thorough review of this material has not been conducted, and latent bias, offensive content, or malicious code may have been unintentionally incorporated into the resulting dataset accordingly.
